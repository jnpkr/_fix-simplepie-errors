# Fix - SimplePie Errors
A WordPress plugin that adds a temporary fix for an incompatibility issue of the built-in library, SimplePie 1.3.1, with PHP 7.1 or above.

## Getting PHP Errors?

```
PHP Warning:  A non-numeric value encountered in .../wp-includes/SimplePie/Parse/Date.php
```

For details, see [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42515).

So until the issue is fixed in the core, this plugin can be used to avoid the warnings for the time being.

## Usage
Just activate the plugin. And the warnings should be gone.
